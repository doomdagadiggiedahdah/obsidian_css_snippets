- [ ] open calendar get sense of avail time for the week
- [ ] open: prev week note, current week note (to be planned)
	- Use prev week reflection area to determine next week ([[w-2025-W05#short reflection|for example]])
- [ ] see what didn't get done last week, decide "do this week or backlog?"
- [ ] check projects to see what to add for this week.
- [ ] book hot yoga


- (( I like this reflection section, nice to have a spot to write out ideas and process what happens next week. ))
- in case I need it, here's how I got to the week template thing: [[weekly cron job]].
	- to be clear, the thing of "mat look at the week's note and get tasks to work on."
